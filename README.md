- Complex filtering system with tag-based search to help users find what they need quickly.
- Adaptive layout that works perfectly on all screen sizes â€” mobile, tablet, and desktop.

- Custom hooks and components to handle specific logic and UI needs.

My Role
I built this project solo, crafting a custom 404 page, implementing light/dark mode with next-themes, and integrating complex tag filtering. I used Shadcn/ui components for polished UI, plus custom hooks like CustomNihilCave to solve unique challenges. This project helped me deepen my Next.js 15 skills and explore modern frontend patterns.
